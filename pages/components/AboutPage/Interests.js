					It's been brilliant learning with{' '}

						Â School of Code
					</a>
					about different areas of tech. One of the areas I really enjoy is working with the front end and
					developing with Javascript and React. I like the problem solving aspects and thinking about the
					relationships between components and deciding which methods are required to generate the correct
					information needed to build an application. In my latest project, I have also enjoyed building the
					back end and working on building the database using postgreSQL and thinking about the routes and
					functions required to link up with the front end. I also enjoy design but I feel I need more
					practise and guidance on design principles and how to use the design libraries.
