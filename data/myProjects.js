The data is collected from an online API called Spoonacular. My biggest challange was collecting a specific recipe ID from one end point to be used in another API call.'

I then progressed to search for three ingredients like the original project and my final sprint now enables the user to choose the number of ingredients they would like to include & how many recipes they would like to choose from. Lastly the project was styled using Chakra UI. '

			'Week 9 of School of Code introduced me to my first full week of engineering. Our team developed a full stack application which would be helpful for new bootcampers. As bootcampers work remotely we decided to build a platform where they could annoymously share their thoughts & feelings of the day and give each other encouragement on such a fast-paced course. With just a week, the project was quite intense and we hit a few stumbling blocks when it came to deploying - however, we hit these early & remained calm to produce our two page application. '

			'The final part of the School of Code bootcamp includes a 4 week project. We had a blank slate when deciding our problem so we used a Miro board to brain storm different ideas. There was a lot of discussin about fitness, health & wellbeing so we decided to combine these topics into a personalised goal-setting app. The project enabled you to select different exercises, recipes, and set personal goals which could be diarised to show up on your dashboard each day. This enabled the user to log in and tick them off as they completed them. To develop our app we used an external API for data as well as creating our own database to store the users schedule and making fetch requests on the required date. We also used Firebase authentication to personalise the application to the user. '
